## My-HTML-Journey
A collection of simple HTML websites progressing towards projects using CSS and JavaScript.

### Project 1: Registration Form
My first HTML project — a simple registration form without CSS.  
It includes these HTML elements:  
- `<form>` tag  
- Radio buttons  
- Checkboxes  
- Dropdown menus

### Project 2: Travel Wishlist
A simple webpage built with basic HTML and CSS that showcases places I’d love to visit.  
Through this project, I’m learning to work with images, CSS transitions, tables, divs, and the flexbox layout model.
