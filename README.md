## My-HTML-Journey
A collection of simple HTML websites progressing towards projects using CSS and JavaScript.


### Project 1: Registration Form
My first HTML project — a simple registration form without CSS.  
It includes these HTML elements:  
- `<form>` tag  
- Radio buttons  
- Checkboxes  
- Dropdown menus


### Project 2: Travel Wishlist
A simple webpage built with basic HTML and CSS that showcases places I’d love to visit.  
Through this project, I’m learning to work with images, CSS transitions, tables, divs, and the flexbox layout model.


### Project 3: Foodie Delight
A responsive and visually appealing website designed to showcase a variety of delicious food items. Built using HTML and CSS, this project emphasizes clean design, user-friendly navigation, and adaptability across different screen sizes.
Through this project, I focused on learning and applying media queries and the flexbox layout model.
Features include:
- Responsive layout that works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Food menu displaying multiple food items with images and descriptions.
- Intuitive navigation for easy browsing of different sections.


### Project 4: Calculator
This is my first project using VanillaJs — a simple calculator built from scratch.
In this project, I primarily used:
- forEach() method
- Event listeners
- if-else conditional blocks
Through this project, I’ve started to understand how to integrate JavaScript into HTML and CSS websites to add interactivity and functionality
